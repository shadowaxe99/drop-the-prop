This is a simple Flask application with a single route for handling customer support issues. The `support` function is a route that accepts POST requests. It expects the request data to be JSON with a 'customer_id' and 'issue'. It retrieves the customer from the database and if the customer is not found, it returns a 404 error. If the customer is found, it processes the issue and returns a response. The `handle_customer_issue` function is where the AI model would process the issue and return a response. For simplicity, this function just returns a static response.
